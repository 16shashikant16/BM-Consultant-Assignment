## write a program that processes strings following these rules.

- split each string into two equal halves.
- find the character that appears in both halves.
- calculate priority value for the common characters.
    * lowercase letters (a-z) have values 1-26
    * uppercase letters (A-Z) have values 27-52
- Sum all the priority values.

Example Input

```
vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp
jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL
PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg
wMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn
ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT
CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw
```

Example Analysis:

- First string: common character is 'p' (priority 16)
- Second string: common character is 'L' (priority 38)
- Third string: common character is 'P' (priority 42)
- Fourth string: common character is 'v' (priority 22)
- Fifth string: common character is 't' (priority 20)
- Sixth string: common character is 's' (priority 19)

Expected Output:
The sum of all priority values (157 for this example)
